| Priority | Tool | Type | Description | Primary Use Cases | Reason for Assigned Priority (Compared to Others) |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
|          |      |      |             |                   |                                                   |

| **1**  | **Apache Spark**     | Processing | Unified engine for batch & stream processing.              | ETL, ML, Streaming, SQL Analytics                     | Most versatile tool across batch, streaming, and ML; dominates cloud/on-prem; higher flexibility than any other engine listed here.                             |
| ------ | -------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2**  | **Apache Kafka**     | Processing | Distributed event streaming platform.                      | Real-time Data Pipelines, Event Streaming             | Core of modern streaming data systems; essential for event-driven architectures; pairs well with many tools here.                                               |
| **3**  | **Apache Flink**     | Processing | Stream-first data processing engine.                       | Low-latency Stream & Batch Processing                 | Leading low-latency stream processing engine; more complex than Spark but essential for sub-second processing.                                                  |
| **4**  | **Apache Airflow**   | Processing | Workflow orchestration platform.                           | Workflow Orchestration, ETL Pipelines                 | Ubiquitous for orchestrating data pipelines; simpler and more scalable than NiFi for orchestrations.                                                            |
| **5**  | **Apache Hadoop**    | Storage    | Distributed Storage (HDFS) & Batch Processing (MapReduce). | Storage Layer (HDFS), Legacy Batch Workloads          | Still common backend storage for large-scale batch processing; legacy but widely deployed.                                                                      |
| **6**  | **Apache Iceberg**   | Storage    | High-performance Table Format for Analytics.               | Data Lakehouse, Large-scale Analytics                 | Most adopted modern lakehouse format; better for cloud-native architectures than Hive/Hudi; rapidly replacing Hive tables.                                      |
| **7**  | **Apache Hive**      | Processing | SQL-like Query Engine for Big Data.                        | Data Warehousing, SQL Analytics                       | Still widely used for SQL-on-Hadoop; declining in favor of Spark SQL/Iceberg but easy for SQL users.                                                            |
| **8**  | **Apache Tez**       | Processing | DAG-based Framework for Hadoop/YARN Ecosystem.             | Optimized Hive & Pig Query Execution                  | Powers Hive/Pig on Hadoop; still relevant in Hadoop-native systems but limited to legacy stacks.                                                                |
| **9**  | **Apache Hudi**      | Storage    | Incremental Data Lakehouse Platform.                       | Real-time Data Lakes, Change Data Capture             | Competes with Iceberg; stronger in streaming & upserts; less broadly adopted than Iceberg, but rising in streaming architectures.                               |
| **10** | **Apache Cassandra** | Storage    | Distributed NoSQL DB for High Availability.                | Operational DB, Time-Series, IoT                      | Leading NoSQL DB for high write throughput, fault-tolerant systems; preferred in FinTech, IoT, and telecom; more operational than analytical.                   |
| **11** | **Apache HBase**     | Storage    | Distributed Wide-Column Store (built on HDFS).             | Low-latency Access to Big Data on HDFS                | Strong in low-latency, random access workloads on Hadoop; losing ground to Cassandra and cloud-native NoSQL solutions; still widely used in HDFS-based systems. |
| **12** | **Apache NiFi**      | Processing | Low-code Data Flow & Pipeline Tool.                        | Data Ingestion, Routing, Flow Automation              | Specialized in data ingestion, edge, and IoT flows; niche compared to Kafka/Airflow for enterprise-grade pipelines.                                             |
| **13** | **Apache Druid**     | Storage    | Real-time OLAP Database for Analytics.                     | OLAP, Time-Series Analytics, Dashboards               | Niche but excellent for OLAP and time-series; very fast for interactive analytics; complements but doesn't replace Spark or Iceberg.                            |
| **14** | **Apache Beam**      | Processing | Unified Model for Batch & Stream Processing.               | Cross-platform Pipelines (runs on Spark, Flink, etc.) | Niche framework mainly popular in GCP (via Dataflow); less widely adopted outside Google ecosystem; rarely replaces Spark/Flink directly.                       |

## ðŸ”— Classification

- **Processing Tools:** Spark, Kafka, Flink, Airflow, Hive, Tez, NiFi, Beam
- **Storage Tools:** Hadoop (HDFS), Iceberg, Hudi, Cassandra, HBase, Druid

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Recommendations:

- For modern architectures: **Spark + Kafka + Airflow + Iceberg** as core stack.
- Use **Cassandra** for highly available operational data stores (IoT, apps).
- Use **Hudi** if you need strong upsert/streaming lakehouse support.
- **HBase** remains in Hadoop-heavy architectures but is niche elsewhere.
- Legacy Hadoop + Hive + Tez systems still common in large enterprises.

## ðŸ”¹ Highlights:

- This table covers **end-to-end big data systems**: ingestion â†’ processing â†’ storage â†’ analytics.
- Apache Cassandra and HBase serve operational NoSQL roles, different from analytics-focused tools.
- Apache Tez operates behind Hive in many Hadoop-based setups.
