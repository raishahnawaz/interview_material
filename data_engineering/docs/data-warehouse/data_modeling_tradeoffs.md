# Data Warehouse Layers and Data Modeling Trade-offs

## ✅ Data Layers in a Data Warehouse

Data warehouses are typically organized into **layers** to enhance **modularity**, **data quality**, and **performance**.

---

### 1. **Raw / Staging Layer**
- **Purpose:** Temporarily holds raw, unprocessed data.
- **Source:** External systems (APIs, logs, databases).
- **Characteristics:**
  - No transformations
  - Often partitioned by load time
- **Usage:** Auditability, reprocessing, debugging.

---

### 2. **Cleansed / Curated Layer**
- **Purpose:** Contains cleaned and validated data.
- **Transformations:**
  - Data type casting
  - Deduplication
  - Null handling
  - Joining reference data
- **Usage:** Trusted base layer for analytics.

---

### 3. **Business / Semantic Layer**
- **Purpose:** Applies business rules and logic.
- **Examples:**
  - Revenue = Price × Quantity
  - KPI derivations
- **Usage:** Self-service BI, semantic clarity for business users.

---

### 4. **Presentation / Reporting / Serving Layer**
- **Purpose:** Optimized for dashboarding and reporting.
- **Format:** Wide tables, aggregates, denormalized models (e.g., star schema).
- **Usage:** Fast, interactive reporting.

---

### 5. **Feature Store (Optional, for ML)**
- **Purpose:** Stores features used in ML models.
- **Supports:** Point-in-time consistency, historical feature retrieval.

## ⚖️ Data Modeling Trade-offs

Choosing a data model involves balancing **performance**, **maintainability**, **storage**, and **flexibility**.

---

### 1. **Star Schema vs Snowflake Schema**

| Aspect      | Star Schema               | Snowflake Schema         |
|-------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Joins       | Fewer (denormalized)      | More (normalized)        |
| Performance | Faster queries             | Slower due to joins      |
| Storage     | Larger (redundancy)       | Smaller                  |
| Maintenance | Easier                    | More complex             |
| Use Case    | Dashboarding, BI           | Data integration, reuse  |

---

### 2. **Normalized vs Denormalized Models**

| Trade-off          | Normalized               | Denormalized               |
|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Redundancy         | Minimal                  | High                       |
| Update Anomalies   | Less likely              | More likely                |
| Query Simplicity   | Complex                  | Simple                     |
| Storage Cost       | Lower                    | Higher                     |
| ETL Complexity     | Higher                   | Lower                      |
| Performance        | Slower (due to joins)    | Faster (single table scan) |

---

### 3. **Batch vs Real-Time Models**

- **Batch Processing:**
  - Simpler and cheaper
  - Higher data latency

- **Real-time Processing:**
  - Complex pipeline (e.g., Kafka + Spark)
  - Higher infrastructure and operational cost

---

### 4. **Wide Tables vs Narrow Tables**

- **Wide Tables**:
  - Many columns
  - Faster for some reports
  - Harder to maintain

- **Narrow Tables**:
  - Many rows
  - Flexible and easier schema evolution
  - Better suited for normalized models

---

## ✅ Summary

- Carefully choosing between normalized and denormalized models depends on use cases like reporting, analysis, or ML.
- Data layers improve **clarity**, **performance**, and **data governance**.
- Trade-offs involve balancing **performance**, **complexity**, and **maintenance**.
