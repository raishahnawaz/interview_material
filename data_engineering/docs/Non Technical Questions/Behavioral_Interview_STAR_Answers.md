##✅ Q1: A Time When You Helped a Colleague Improve

### **Situation**  
Supporting colleagues has been a consistent and fulfilling part of my career—something I genuinely enjoy. In my current role, I actively collaborate with team members during code reviews, project planning meetings, and bi-weekly knowledge-sharing sessions.

We also hold sprint retrospectives where we align on technical achievements and task ownership. I often help teammates onboard to our engineering stack—especially tools they haven't used before, like dbt, PySpark, and test automation frameworks. This includes walkthroughs of code integrations and explaining technical concepts in a practical context.

### **Task**  
One teammate was having difficulty understanding ETL best practices using dbt and Spark, which started affecting their module's progress and causing delays.

### **Action**
I proactively set up a focused knowledge-sharing session. During the session, I broke down the concepts using real-world examples and diagrams to make them easier to grasp. I also provided curated reading materials and created a short internal guide highlighting key best practices and common pitfalls. 

### **Result**
The teammate was able to confidently apply the concepts and successfully deliver their module. They later shared that they reused the same best practices in another part of the project, which contributed to better code quality and fewer review cycles overall.

## ✅ Q2: A time where you did stakeholder management during a conflict

### **Situation**  
While working on a high-priority feature, there was a conflict between the product team and the engineering team regarding the scope and deadlines.

### **Task**  
As the technical lead, my responsibility was to ensure both parties were aligned while balancing delivery timelines and technical feasibility.

### **Action**  
I organized a joint discussion with stakeholders from both sides. I laid out the implementation complexity and resource constraints from the engineering side, and actively listened to the product team’s urgency and business goals. I proposed a phased approach — delivering a simplified version in the current sprint and scheduling enhancements for the next cycle.

### **Result**  
Both teams agreed to the plan. The initial release was delivered on time, and the trust built from this conflict resolution led to smoother collaboration in later sprints.
