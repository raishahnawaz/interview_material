# Use Case 4: NLP Summarization (HuggingFace Transformers)

This use case demonstrates extractive and abstractive text summarization using HuggingFace Transformers. It covers:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Summarization with pre-trained models (e.g., T5, BART)
- Evaluation of summary quality
- Containerized setup for reproducibility

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**: Loads a subset of the CNN/DailyMail dataset for summarization.
2. **Summarization**: Uses a pre-trained T5 model to generate abstractive summaries for news articles.
3. **Evaluation**: Simple word overlap metric is used for demo; in practice, use ROUGE or BLEU.

## Code Highlights
- Demonstrates end-to-end summarization with a pre-trained transformer model.
- Minimal, interview-ready code with clear comments.
- Easily extensible to other summarization models or datasets.

## Practical Tips
- Use pre-trained models (e.g., T5, BART) for strong baselines in summarization tasks.
- For evaluation, use ROUGE for more robust comparison with reference summaries.
- Use Docker for reproducibility: `docker build -t nlp-summarization . && docker run -it nlp-summarization`.
