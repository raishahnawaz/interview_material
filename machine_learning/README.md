## AR/VR GEC (Gesture, Estimation, and Cognition) Use Case Suite

This suite covers advanced AR/VR machine learning applications, each with modular, containerized code, detailed documentation, and interview Q&A. The following use cases are included:

| Use Case                        | Recommended Dataset(s)         | Why Best Choice?                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Object Detection                 | COCO                          | Large, diverse, standard benchmark, supports detection/segmentation                               |
| Gesture Recognition              | NVIDIA Dynamic Hand Gesture   | Real-time, depth+RGB, many classes, robust to real-world variation                                |
| Pose Estimation                  | MPII Human Pose, COCO Keypoints | Standard for pose, diverse, well-annotated                                                        |
| Scene Understanding              | SUN RGB-D, ScanNet            | 3D, semantic, indoor scenes, perfect for AR anchoring                                             |
| 3D Reconstruction                | ShapeNet, Pix3D               | Large-scale, 3D models, real images, supports 2D-to-3D learning                                   |

**Why these datasets?**
- They are widely recognized, well-annotated, and have strong community support.
- They cover real-world scenarios and are benchmarks for state-of-the-art models.
- They ensure your project is both interview-ready and practical for hands-on learning and demonstration.

Each use case will include:
- Modular, production-ready code (PyTorch/Keras)
- Dockerized setup
- Beginner-to-expert documentation
- Interview Q&A
- Data download/integration scripts
