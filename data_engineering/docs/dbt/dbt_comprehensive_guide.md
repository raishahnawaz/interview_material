# üìò What is dbt (Data Build Tool)?

**dbt (Data Build Tool)** is an open-source command-line tool that enables **analytics engineers** and **data teams** to transform raw data in a warehouse into clean, tested, and documented datasets for analytics and machine learning. It focuses on **data transformation** within the modern data stack, especially in **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** pipelines ‚Äî where data is extracted and loaded into the warehouse first, and then transformed inside it.

At its core, **dbt allows you to write modular SQL queries as models**, version them using Git, and execute them in a structured, automated way.

## üöÄ Key Concepts

| Concept        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Model**      | A SQL file that defines a transformation logic (e.g., `SELECT` statements).|
| **Materialization** | How the model is stored in the warehouse (table, view, incremental).    |
| **Jinja**       | dbt uses Jinja templating to enable dynamic SQL and macros.                |
| **Tests**      | dbt allows for **data testing** (e.g., uniqueness, non-null, relationships).|
| **Docs**       | dbt generates data lineage & documentation from models and YAML configs.   |
| **Sources**    | Definitions for external raw data sources, often loaded by Fivetran, Airbyte, etc.|
| **Seeds**      | CSVs that are version-controlled and loaded into the warehouse for use in transformations.|

## üõ†Ô∏è dbt Workflow

1. **Define Models**: Write SQL in a modular fashion to transform raw data.
2. **Test Data**: Validate data quality through built-in or custom tests.
3. **Document**: Use YAML files to describe data models, fields, and their relationships.
4. **Build Lineage**: Automatically tracks dependencies between models for audit and understanding.
5. **Run & Deploy**: Execute dbt models using CLI, dbt Cloud, or orchestration tools like Airflow.

## üí° Use Cases of dbt

### 1. **Data Transformation in ELT Pipelines**
- Transform raw data loaded into warehouses like **BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks**.

### 2. **Data Modeling & Curation**
- Create **dimensional models** (e.g., fact and dimension tables).

### 3. **Data Quality Testing**
- Automatically test for:
  - Nulls in primary keys
  - Duplicates
  - Foreign key relationships
  - Value ranges

### 4. **Data Lineage & Documentation**
- Auto-generates interactive DAGs and documentation to understand how data flows.

### 5. **Version Control & CI/CD for Analytics**
- dbt projects are written in code (SQL + YAML), making them **version-controllable** with Git.

### 6. **Collaborative Data Development**
- Encourages **code reviews**, **unit testing**, and **team ownership** of analytics logic.

### 7. **Incremental & Performance Optimized Transforms**
- dbt supports **incremental materialization**, updating only new or changed data.

### 8. **Enabling Metrics Layers**
- dbt supports **metrics definitions** in YAML that feed into BI tools or APIs.

## üß± Where Does dbt Fit in the Modern Data Stack?

```
[Extract]     [Load]        [Transform]          [Serve]
  Fivetran ‚Üí Snowpipe ‚Üí    dbt models  ‚Üí   Looker, Power BI, Tableau
  Airbyte      Stitch        (SQL)          Streamlit, Dash, APIs
```

- **dbt specializes in the "T" of ELT**
- Complements tools like:
  - **Fivetran/Airbyte** (data ingestion)
  - **Airflow** (workflow orchestration)
  - **ML models** (for feature generation and QA)

## üìö Example

### A dbt Model (SQL)

```sql
-- models/stg_customers.sql
SELECT
    id AS customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    created_at
FROM {{ source('raw', 'customers') }}
```

### A Test (YAML)

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    columns:
      - name: customer_id
        tests:
          - not_null
          - unique
```

### A Seed

```csv
-- seeds/countries.csv
code,name
US,United States
PK,Pakistan
IN,India
```
