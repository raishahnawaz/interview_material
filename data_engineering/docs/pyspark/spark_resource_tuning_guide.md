## 🗂 Scenario:
**Join between:**
- Table A: 5 TB  
- Table B: 2 TB  
- **Total data** involved: **~7 TB**

---

## ⚙️ Cluster Configuration (Assumed)
- **Cluster Type:** YARN or Kubernetes
- **Total Nodes:** 20 worker nodes
- **Each Node:**
  - **Memory:** 128 GB
  - **vCPUs:** 32 cores

> Total resources: **2.56 TB RAM**, **640 cores**

## 🧠 Basic Concepts Explained

### 🧱 What is a Spark Executor?
A Spark **executor** is a JVM process launched on a worker node that runs your Spark tasks. It holds:
- A slice of memory (e.g., 30 GB)
- A number of CPU cores (e.g., 5 cores)
- A thread pool equal to the number of cores

### ⚙️ What is a Core?
Each **core** represents a single thread of execution. If an executor has 5 cores, it can run 5 **tasks** at the same time.

### 🧪 What is a Task?
A **task** is the smallest unit of work in Spark. A job (e.g., joining two tables) is divided into **stages**, and each stage is further divided into multiple **tasks**.

### 🧵 What is a Task Slot?
Each **core** in an executor provides **one task slot** — the ability to run one task concurrently.  
So if you have:
- 80 executors
- Each with 5 cores

→ Total **task slots = 80 × 5 = 400 concurrent tasks**

### 🔄 What is a Job?
A **job** is a complete computation in Spark — like a SQL query, table join, or transformation.

## 📌 Objective:
Efficiently configure:
- `--executor-memory`
- `--executor-cores`
- `--num-executors`
- `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`

## 🔹 Scenario 1: **Single Job Using Whole Cluster**

### 💡 Goal:
Maximize cluster usage, reduce spill and shuffle overhead.

### ✅ Recommended Settings:
| Parameter               | Value                        | Reason |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| `--executor-memory`     | 30 GB                        | Leaves ~2 GB for overhead (YARN needs ~7%) |
| `--executor-cores`      | 5                            | Balanced CPU/memory ratio; avoids task starvation |
| `--num-executors`       | 80                           | (640 total cores / 5 cores per executor) |
| `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` | 1600 | 7 TB data ⇒ large shuffle; use 2–3x total executor cores to optimize parallelism |

### 💡 Calculation:

- Total usable memory = 30 GB × 80 executors = **2.4 TB**
- Total task slots = 5 × 80 = **400 concurrent tasks**
- 1600 shuffle partitions → 4 tasks per core ≈ good parallelism

## 🔹 Scenario 2: **Multiple Jobs Running in Parallel**

### 💡 Goal:
Avoid resource contention; allow room for other jobs.

### ✅ Recommended Settings (Per Job):
| Parameter               | Value                        | Reason |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| `--executor-memory`     | 20 GB                        | Less memory to avoid out-of-memory across jobs |
| `--executor-cores`      | 4                            | Conservative use of cores |
| `--num-executors`       | 40                           | Allows 2–3 jobs to run concurrently |
| `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` | 800 | Lower concurrency, fewer partitions needed |

### 💡 Calculation:

- 20 GB × 40 = 800 GB memory → leaves space for other jobs
- 4 × 40 = 160 cores used per job (3 jobs = 480 cores)
- 800 partitions → ~2 tasks per core → less overhead under load

## 📊 Summary Table

| Cluster Mode | Executor Memory | Executor Cores | Num Executors | Shuffle Partitions |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Single Job** | 30 GB             | 5              | 80             | 1600                |
| **Multi-Job**  | 20 GB             | 4              | 40             | 800                 |

## 🔍 Tips:
- Monitor Spark UI for skewed tasks and GC time.
- Enable dynamic allocation **only** if jobs are bursty.
- Always test with a representative data sample before scaling.
