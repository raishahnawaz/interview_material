## Q1: A Time When You Helped a Colleague Improve

### **Situation**  
Supporting colleagues has been a consistent and fulfilling part of my career—something I genuinely enjoy. In my current role, I actively collaborate with team members during code reviews, project planning meetings, and bi-weekly knowledge-sharing sessions.

We also hold sprint retrospectives where we align on technical achievements and task ownership. I often help teammates onboard to our engineering stack—especially tools they haven't used before, like dbt, PySpark, and test automation frameworks. This includes walkthroughs of code integrations and explaining technical concepts in a practical context.

### **Task**  
One teammate was having difficulty understanding ETL best practices using dbt and Spark, which started affecting their module's progress and causing delays.

### **Action**
I proactively set up a focused knowledge-sharing session. During the session, I broke down the concepts using real-world examples and diagrams to make them easier to grasp. I also provided curated reading materials and created a short internal guide highlighting key best practices and common pitfalls. 

### **Result**
The teammate was able to confidently apply the concepts and successfully deliver their module. They later shared that they reused the same best practices in another part of the project, which contributed to better code quality and fewer review cycles overall.

### 🔁 Tip
If you frequently help colleagues, you can say:
> “While I regularly help colleagues through code reviews, design discussions, and knowledge sharing, one instance that stands out is…”

## Q2: A time where you did stakeholder management during a conflict?
Start with -> Product Support Analyst Role/Bridging Engineering Teams and the Client.
Then similar answer as of Q3 below
## Q3: Can you provide an example where your communication and collaboration skills were essential to the success of a project?
### **Situation**  
I was leading the machine learning component of an AQI forecasting project. The model relied on multiple data streams, but one of the most critical inputs was sensor data that the client was responsible for providing.

### **Task**  
We were approaching the final delivery phase, and a delay in receiving the sensor data risked pushing back our timeline. My task was to ensure that this dependency didn’t derail the project and to keep both our internal team and the client aligned.

### **Action**  
I initiated regular check-ins with the client’s technical and field teams to clarify the importance of the data for model training. I communicated how the delay would directly affect accuracy and delivery. Internally, I reorganized our workflow so we could continue progressing on parts of the pipeline that used weather and satellite data, minimizing downtime.

### **Result**  
Through clear communication and proactive collaboration, the client expedited their data transfer. We were able to complete the model training as planned and deliver the project on time, maintaining both quality and client trust.


## Q4: How you divide or assign tasks to your team members?

### Product Setup
Yearly, Quartelry, and monthly OKRs defined, though refine or reprioritize based on post sprint review sessions and discussion

### Services Setup
Quartelry and monthly OKRs defined, though refined or repriotise


1. Based on individuals Strength
2. If someone needs a new learning and we have a time buffer - task delivery deadline is not very harsh or feature not burning
3. Being there for the team, showing support and empathy to keep people taking ownership and stay motivated for on time delivery
