# Fault Tolerance in Apache Spark

Apache Spark ensures fault tolerance through a combination of lineage information, resilient data structures, and recovery mechanisms.

---

## üîÅ 1. Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs)

**RDDs** are the fundamental data structure in Spark. They are immutable and distributed across nodes.

### Key Points:
- Each RDD maintains **lineage information**, which is a record of the sequence of transformations used to build it.
- If a partition of an RDD is lost, it can be **recomputed** from its lineage.

### Why it ensures fault tolerance:
- Instead of replicating data, Spark recomputes lost partitions on failure using lineage, saving memory and bandwidth.

## üí• 2. DAG and Lineage Graphs

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):
- Spark builds a DAG of stages and tasks before execution.
- Each stage contains tasks based on partitions.

### Role in fault tolerance:
- If a node fails, only the tasks on that node are rescheduled.
- Spark knows exactly which operations need to be re-run thanks to the DAG.

## üß† 3. Task Re-execution

- When a task fails (e.g., due to executor/node crash), Spark re-executes the failed task **on another healthy node**.
- Task failure is **localized**, meaning only failed parts are re-executed.

---

## üß∞ 4. Checkpointing

For complex lineage chains or iterative algorithms (e.g., PageRank), Spark allows **checkpointing**:

### What is it?
- Persisting an RDD to stable storage (e.g., HDFS) to truncate its lineage.

### Why it helps:
- Prevents long lineage chains from causing recomputation overhead.
- Useful in iterative jobs or when memory is constrained.

### Code Example:
```scala
rdd.checkpoint()
```

## üíæ 5. Data Replication (Spark Streaming / Structured Streaming)

- For streaming applications, fault tolerance is achieved via **Write Ahead Logs (WAL)** and **checkpointing**.
- Each batch of streaming data is **logged to persistent storage** before processing.

---

## üß† 6. Executor and Driver Recovery

- If an executor fails, Spark **reschedules its tasks** on other available executors.
- If the **driver fails**, recovery depends on cluster manager (YARN, Kubernetes, etc.):
  - **YARN**: Supports automatic driver recovery with cluster mode.
  - **Kubernetes**: Spark-on-K8s supports restarting failed driver pods.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Fault tolerance in Spark is largely enabled through its RDD lineage, DAG execution model, and integration with cluster managers. This makes Spark robust and reliable for large-scale distributed data processing.
