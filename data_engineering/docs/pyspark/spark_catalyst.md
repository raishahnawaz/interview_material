# 🚀 Apache Spark Catalyst Engine

## What is Catalyst?

Catalyst is Spark’s **query optimization framework**, part of the Spark SQL component.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Logical Plan Optimization**: Rewrites queries for efficiency (e.g., predicate pushdown, constant folding)
- **Rule-Based Optimizations**: Applies a series of rules to improve query plans
- **Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)**: Uses statistics to choose more efficient plans
- **Extensible**: Supports user-defined rules and optimizations

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Parse**: SQL query is parsed into an unresolved logical plan
2. **Analysis**: Resolves references using catalog metadata
3. **Optimization**: Applies logical rules to improve the plan
4. **Physical Planning**: Chooses physical operators based on cost
5. **Code Generation**: Generates optimized bytecode for execution

## 🧠 Use Cases

- SQL optimization
- DataFrame and Dataset transformations
- Query planning and analysis
