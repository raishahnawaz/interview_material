# 🔀 Comparing `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, and `combineByKey` in PySpark

In PySpark, key-based operations on RDDs are essential for distributed processing. Among them, `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, and `combineByKey` are often used — but choosing the right one is critical for performance and correctness.

---

## ✅ When to Use Each

### 🧠 Use `groupByKey` When:
- You need **all values for a key** (not just an aggregated result).
- You're performing **non-associative** logic.
- You require **custom post-processing** like sorting or applying ML models per key.

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("a", 2), ("b", 3)])
rdd.groupByKey().mapValues(list).collect()
# Output: [('a', [1, 2]), ('b', [3])]
```

⚠️ Downside: All values are shuffled → high memory usage and slower performance.

---

### 🏎️ Use `reduceByKey` When:
- You're doing **aggregation with associative and commutative** operations (e.g., sum, count).
- You want **fast** and **memory-efficient** execution.

```python
rdd.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y).collect()
```

👍 Combines values **locally on each partition** before shuffling → minimal data movement.

---

### 🧰 Use `combineByKey` When:
- You need **custom aggregation logic**, including different input and output types.
- You want **fine control** over:
  - Creating a combiner,
  - Merging a value into a combiner,
  - Merging two combiners.

```python
rdd.combineByKey(
    lambda x: (x, 1),                 # Create combiner
    lambda acc, x: (acc[0] + x, acc[1] + 1),  # Merge value into combiner
    lambda acc1, acc2: (acc1[0] + acc2[0], acc1[1] + acc2[1])  # Merge combiners
)
```

Example use case: Calculating average per key.

## 🧠 Tips

- Default to `reduceByKey` for performance.
- Use `groupByKey` only when you **must access all values per key**.
- Use `combineByKey` when you need **flexible custom logic** beyond basic reductions.


### 🔁 How `combineByKey` Works in PySpark

`combineByKey` is the most **flexible** and **powerful** of the key-based aggregation transformations in Spark. It allows **custom aggregation logic** and is used under the hood by both `reduceByKey` and `aggregateByKey`.

#### 🛠️ Internals of `combineByKey`

It performs aggregation in **three phases**:

| Phase             | Description                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create Combiner   | Creates initial combiner from a single value per key         |
| Merge Value       | Merges subsequent values in the same partition into the combiner |
| Merge Combiners   | Combines results across partitions (after shuffle)           |

---

#### 🔀 Local vs Shuffle Behavior

| Aspect                    | Behavior                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Local aggregation         | ✅ Yes – values are merged within partition       |
| Shuffle across partitions | ✅ Yes – then merged across partitions            |
| Like `reduceByKey`?       | ✅ Yes, but more flexible                         |
| Like `groupByKey`?        | ❌ No – does **not** collect all values first     |

---

### ✅ Use `combineByKey` When:

- You need custom logic for:
  - Initializing the aggregator (e.g., a list, dict, or complex object)
  - Merging values (e.g., appending to a list)
  - Merging combiners (e.g., combining two lists)
- You want **local aggregation before shuffle** (unlike `groupByKey`)

---

### 🧪 Example

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize([("a", 1), ("a", 2), ("b", 3), ("b", 4)])

def create_combiner(v): return [v]
def merge_value(c, v): return c + [v]
def merge_combiners(c1, c2): return c1 + c2

rdd.combineByKey(create_combiner, merge_value, merge_combiners).collect()
# Output: [('a', [1, 2]), ('b', [3, 4])]
