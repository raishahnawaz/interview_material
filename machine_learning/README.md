# Machine Learning Interview Preparation

This directory contains practical, interview-focused use cases and documentation for AI Engineer / Data Scientist roles, with a focus on NLP, LLMs, and modern ML workflows.

## Structure

- `use_case_*/` — Each folder contains a self-contained use case (code, Dockerfile, requirements, docs)
- `docs/` — Unified architecture and ecosystem documentation

## Use Cases (Planned)
1. Tabular ML (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
2. NLP Text Classification (spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers)
3. LLM Fine-tuning (HuggingFace Transformers)
4. NLP Summarization/Information Extraction (optional)
5. Model Deployment (FastAPI/Flask)

Each use case includes:
- `code/` — Scripts and notebooks
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` — Containerization
- `README.md` — Code explanation
- `interview_qa.md` — Interview Q&A

## Documentation
- `docs/architecture_overview.md` — High-level ecosystem and architecture (with diagrams)
- `docs/architecture_with_code.md` — Practical/code-focused architecture guide

**Start with any use case or doc. Each is self-contained and ready for interview prep or hands-on learning.**
