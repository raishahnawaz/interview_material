## üîë 1. Important Concepts for Relational Databases

### ACID Properties

Relational databases adhere strictly to ACID principles to ensure data integrity and reliability.

- **Atomicity**: Transactions are fully completed or fully rolled back.
- **Consistency**: Database remains consistent before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Committed data persists even in the event of failures.

### Transaction Isolation Levels

Defines how transaction integrity is visible to other operations:

- **Read Uncommitted**: Transactions may read uncommitted data (possible dirty reads).
- **Read Committed**: Prevents dirty reads; still susceptible to non-repeatable reads.
- **Repeatable Read**: Guarantees consistent data throughout transaction; phantom reads possible.
- **Serializable**: Fully isolated; prevents dirty, non-repeatable, and phantom reads.

### Indexing Strategies

Indexes significantly speed query performance but must be used judiciously:

- **Clustered Index**: Physically orders table rows; one per table (usually primary key).
- **Non-clustered Index**: Logical pointers to data rows; multiple per table.
- **Composite Index**: Index created on multiple columns to speed multi-column searches.
- **Covering Index**: Includes all columns required by a query to avoid additional table lookups.

## üóÉÔ∏è 2. Organizing Delta Lake for Efficiency, Security, and Downstream Use

### Delta Lake Organization Best Practices

1. **Implement Medallion Architecture:**
   - **Bronze (Raw Data)**: Immutable raw ingestion layer.
   - **Silver (Refined Data)**: Cleaned, standardized, validated, and enriched.
   - **Gold (Curated Data)**: Aggregated, highly optimized for BI, analytics, and ML.

2. **Partitioning and Optimization:**
   - Partition by date/time, region, or business domain to speed up queries.
   - Regularly run OPTIMIZE and Z-ORDER commands for faster reads.

3. **Schema Enforcement and Evolution:**
   - Enforce schema for data integrity and consistency.
   - Manage schema evolution through structured changes, avoiding disruptive updates.

4. **Data Versioning and Time Travel:**
   - Enable robust audit trails and rollback capabilities.
   - Time travel for historical query capabilities and fault recovery.

5. **Security and Access Control:**
   - Utilize RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for fine-grained permissions.
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
   - Secure sensitive data using masking and tokenization.

## üöö 3. Migration Strategy from Relational Database (SQL Server) to Modern Data Warehouse (BigQuery)

### Phase 1: Assessment & Planning
- Inventory current databases, tables, views, stored procedures.
- Identify schema complexity and data dependencies.
- Determine business requirements and prioritize datasets.

### Phase 2: Schema & Data Migration
- Map relational schemas to BigQuery's denormalized schema design.
- Leverage tools such as Google Data Transfer Service or third-party ETL tools (Fivetran, Stitch).
- Validate schema translation and handle data type discrepancies.

### Phase 3: Data Validation & Quality Assurance
- Conduct data validation checks post-migration:
  - Row counts, data type validation, referential integrity.
  - Data accuracy using test queries comparing results from legacy DB and BigQuery.
- Ensure completeness through incremental load verification.

### Phase 4: Optimization & Performance Tuning
- Implement BigQuery best practices:
  - Proper partitioning and clustering.
  - Efficient query design and cost optimization.
  - Continuous monitoring and performance analysis.

### Phase 5: Transition & Training
- Gradual transition to new data warehouse solution:
  - Phased rollout to stakeholders and end-users.
  - Training sessions to familiarize users with BigQuery.
  - Document new workflows and maintain clear, updated documentation.

### Phase 6: Monitoring & Continuous Improvement
- Establish ongoing monitoring and alerting:
  - Utilize Google Cloud Monitoring tools and dashboards.
  - Continuous improvement cycles based on performance analytics and user feedback.
