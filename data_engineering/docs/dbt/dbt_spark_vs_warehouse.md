# 📘 dbt-Spark and Spark SQL: Clarifying Their Roles and Execution Context

---

##  User's Question

> Is it relevant to say it's dbt Spark as dbt code normally translates to target warehouse (i.e., BigQuery) syntax/dialect and is relevant for transformation steps and not sourcing?

---

## ✅ Short Answer

Yes, it **is** relevant to say **"dbt-spark"** when referring to using dbt with **Apache Spark** as the execution engine.

However, your insight is correct — dbt is focused on **transformations**, and it compiles SQL code to the dialect of the target engine (BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark SQL, etc.). It does **not** perform data ingestion (sourcing).

---

## 🔎 Clarifying What "dbt-spark" Means

**dbt-spark** is:
- A **dbt adapter/plugin** that targets Apache Spark.
- It allows dbt to compile Jinja-templated SQL into **Spark SQL dialect**.
- It executes that SQL on a Spark environment (e.g., Spark Thrift Server, Databricks, or native Spark).

---

## 🧠 Key Points About dbt

| Feature                     | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| **Focus**                  | Transformation (T in ELT), not extraction or loading |
| **Dialect Compilation**    | Compiles SQL to match the target engine's syntax |
| **Materializations**       | Supports `table`, `view`, `incremental`, etc. |
| **Execution Environment**  | Runs on the compute engine provided (e.g., Spark, BigQuery) |
| **No Native Ingestion**    | Raw data must already be in the platform (e.g., HDFS, Hive, Delta Lake, etc.) |

---

## ⚙️ What Happens with dbt-Spark?

When using **dbt-spark**:
- Your models are written in **dbt SQL + Jinja**.
- dbt compiles them to **Spark SQL dialect**.
- The code is then executed on a Spark engine (via Spark session, Thrift Server, or Databricks).

---

## 🧪 Example dbt Model Compiled for Spark

Input (model file `stg_customers.sql`):

```sql
SELECT
    id AS customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    created_at
FROM `{{ source('raw', 'customers') }}`
```

Compiled to Spark SQL:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW default.stg_customers AS
SELECT
    id AS customer_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    created_at
FROM raw.customers
```

## ❌ Common Misunderstanding

> Can Spark execute code inside a warehouse like BigQuery?

No. **Spark and warehouses like BigQuery are different execution environments**.

---

## 🔄 Spark vs Data Warehouse Execution

| Engine      | Location        | Execution | Typical Use |
|-------------|------------------|------------|--------------|
| **Spark**   | Your cluster      | Spark SQL  | Lakehouse, ML pipelines |
| **BigQuery**| Google-managed    | BigQuery SQL | Serverless data warehouse |
| **Snowflake** | Cloud-managed | Snowflake SQL | Data warehousing |
| **Redshift** | AWS-managed     | Redshift SQL | OLAP engine |

You cannot run **Spark code inside BigQuery** or vice versa. However, Spark **can read from/write to** these platforms via connectors.

---

## 🔄 Spark with External Warehouses

### ✅ Scenario 1: Spark Reads from BigQuery

```python
df = spark.read \
    .format("bigquery") \
    .option("table", "project.dataset.table") \
    .load()
```

You transform data in **Spark**, and optionally write results back to BigQuery.

### ✅ Scenario 2: Spark IS the Data Platform

- Data resides in **Parquet**, **Delta Lake**, or **Hive**.
- Spark performs transformations and persists new tables/views/models.
- dbt-spark works directly on this layer.

---

## ✅ When Is Spark SQL Relevant?

| Scenario                                    | Spark SQL Relevance | Why? |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------|------|
| Data in Delta/Parquet/Hive                  | ✅ Yes               | Spark is the compute engine |
| Unified data + ML pipelines                 | ✅ Yes               | Spark integrates MLlib, pandas, etc. |
| Running in Databricks/Spark on K8s          | ✅ Yes               | Spark-native workflows |
| Transforming data inside BigQuery/Snowflake | ❌ No                | Use warehouse-specific dbt adapter |
| Real-time streaming with Spark Structured   | ✅ Yes               | Best handled in Spark |

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

- Use **dbt-spark** when your compute platform is Spark.
- Use **warehouse-native dbt** when your target platform is serverless or optimized for SQL analytics.
- dbt is for **transformations only**, regardless of the execution engine.

---

> ✅ Spark is a compute framework.  
> ✅ BigQuery, Snowflake, and Redshift are serverless/commercial DWHs.  
> ✅ dbt adapts to both, but cannot merge their compute layers.
