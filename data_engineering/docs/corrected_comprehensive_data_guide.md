# üìò Comprehensive Guide: Data Warehousing, Data Lake, Delta Lake, ML Pipelines, Relational DBs, and Migration Strategies

---

## üì¶ 1. Data Warehousing & Data Lake

### What is a Data Warehouse (DWH)?
A **Data Warehouse** is a centralized repository for structured data designed for query and analysis.

- Optimized for analytical queries (OLAP)
- Schema-on-write (rigid schema)
- Examples: Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery

### What is a Data Lake?
A **Data Lake** stores raw, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

- Schema-on-read, supports all data types (CSV, Parquet, Images, JSON, XML)
- Examples: AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage, GCP Cloud Storage

## üîë 2. Important Concepts for Relational Databases

### ACID Properties
- **Atomicity**: Transactions are fully completed or rolled back entirely.
- **Consistency**: Maintains consistency before/after transactions.
- **Isolation**: Transactions execute independently.
- **Durability**: Data persists after transaction completion.

### Transaction Isolation Levels
- **Read Uncommitted**: May read uncommitted data.
- **Read Committed**: Prevents dirty reads; non-repeatable reads possible.
- **Repeatable Read**: Consistent data throughout a transaction.
- **Serializable**: Fully isolated transactions.

### Indexing Strategies
- **Clustered**: Physically orders rows (usually primary key).
- **Non-clustered**: Logical data pointers.
- **Composite**: Index on multiple columns.
- **Covering**: Includes all columns needed by queries.

## üß™ 3. Delta Lake

Delta Lake provides **ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel** for data lakes.

### Medallion Architecture
- **Bronze**: Raw data ingestion.
- **Silver**: Cleaned, standardized data.
- **Gold**: Curated data optimized for analytics.

### Organization for Efficiency and Security
- Partition data logically (by date, region).
- Regularly optimize using Z-ORDER.
- Enforce and evolve schema consistently.
- Implement time travel/versioning for audit.
- Secure access (RBAC, Encryption).

## üèóÔ∏è 4. Semantic Layer vs Business Layer
- **Semantic Layer**: Abstract definitions for BI (Looker, dbt).
- **Business Layer**: Tables reflecting business entities.

---

## üß± 5. Data Vault vs Data Mart
- **Data Vault**: Agile, historical data modeling (hubs, links, satellites).
- **Data Mart**: Specific reporting needs (star schema).

---

## üîÅ 6. Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)
- Types: SCD-0, SCD-1, SCD-2, SCD-3, SCD-6.

---

## üß¨ 7. ML Pipelines
### Types of Models
- Structured: XGBoost, Logistic Regression
- Unstructured: CNN, ResNet
- Text/NLP: BERT, GPT

### ML in Finance
- Credit Risk, Fraud Detection, Sentiment Analysis.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Classification: Accuracy, ROC-AUC.
- Regression: MAE, RMSE.
- Forecasting: MAPE.

---

## üß† 8. NLP and LLMs Evolution
- NLP Generations: Rule-based ‚Üí ML ‚Üí Transformers ‚Üí LLMs (GPT models)
- RAG Architectures: Retrieval + generation (Vector DB: FAISS).
- MCP Pattern: Model, Context, Prompt.
- LLM Metrics: BLEU, BERTScore.

### Agents & Tools
- LangChain, AutoGPT, LangGraph.

---

## üöö 9. Migration Strategy: Relational DB to Modern DWH

### Phase 1: Assessment
- Inventory, schema analysis.

### Phase 2: Migration
- Schema mapping, use ETL tools (Google Data Transfer, Fivetran).

### Phase 3: Validation
- Data integrity checks, incremental verification.

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Partitioning, clustering, query tuning.

### Phase 5: Transition
- Phased rollout, user training, documentation.

### Phase 6: Monitoring
- Continuous performance monitoring and improvements.
